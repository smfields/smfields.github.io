## About Me
I'm a 24 year old software developer living and working in Madison, Wisconsin. I currently work for Epic Systems, the largest electronic health record vendor in the United States. I graduated from North Carolina State University in 2020 with a Bachelor of Science degree in computer science. 

While in school I had a particular interest in software security. While I am officially part of the inpatient team at work, lately I have been helping the security team with their projects. Most recently I have been working on implementing smart card login and authentication into a web application.

### Projects
#### Shuffle: Music Party Game
##### [shuffle.smfields.net](https://shuffle.smfields.net)
Shuffle is a game where players either compete against one another, or collaborate with one another, to try and identify a song that is playing. Players are on the clock, and must try to name the song and the artist as quickly as possible. They can choose from a list of playlists based on popular genres, or they can choose to play with their own custom playlist.
